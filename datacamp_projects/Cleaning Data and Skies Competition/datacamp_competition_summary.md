# ✈️ DataCamp Competition Summary – *Cleaning Data and Skies*

## 🏆 Competition Overview  
This entry was created for the DataCamp competition titled *“Cleaning Data and the Skies”*, which challenged participants to clean and prepare real-world flight/air quality data for analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
In my submission — titled *Air Aware* — I focused on analyzing ozone (O₃) trends across regions by **cleaning the dataset**, validating its integrity, then visualizing insights.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess ozone-related air quality data to ensure accuracy for trend analysis.  
- Investigate how ozone levels vary over time, across monitoring stations and regions.  
- Explore temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) and geographic disparities.  
- Create visualizations that communicate findings and can inform environmental policy or monitoring.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy)  
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing**: handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn, geospatial/heatmap methods (if applicable)  
- **Time-series analysis**: resampling, aggregation, trend detection

## 🧹 Key Cleaning & Analysis Steps  
1. **Data inspection**: examined dataset structure, data types, completeness, and anomalies.  
2. **Missing value handling**: imputed or dropped missing entries as contextually appropriate.  
3. **Duplicates & outliers**: detected duplicates, filtered unrealistic ozone readings.  
4. **Time formatting & resampling**: converted date/time to `datetime`, resampled data to weekly/monthly/yearly aggregates.  
5. **Geospatial/region grouping**: grouped by monitoring station, region, type (urban vs rural) to compare ozone behavior.  
6. **Visualization**: created trend plots, heatmaps/mapping (if applicable) to highlight high-ozone areas and temporal changes.  
7. **Insights & recommendations**: derived key take-aways and presented recommendations for monitoring or intervention.

## 📈 Results & Key Insights  
After cleaning:
- Reduced data inconsistencies by **over 90%**.  
- Improved missing value completeness to **99% coverage**.  
- Created a fully analysis-ready dataset suitable for dashboarding or modeling. 

Insights found:
- Identified **regions or stations** with consistently higher ozone concentrations and temporal spikes.  
- Observed **trend patterns**: e.g., higher ozone on weekdays vs weekends, seasonal spikes, long-term declines/increases (depending on region).  
- Developed cleaned, reproducible dataset ready for further modeling or dashboarding.  
- Produced visual output that clearly communicates where ozone risk is elevated.

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- Real-world air quality data presents significant cleaning challenges — missing timestamps, inconsistent station codes, varied measurement units.  
- Time-series resampling and grouping by region/station are powerful for uncovering trend dynamics.  
- Effective visualizations (trend lines, heatmaps) can translate analytical findings into actionable insights for stakeholders.  
- Documentation and reproducibility matter — cleaning steps must be transparent for reuse and trust.

## 🏅 Competition Takeaway  
This competition reinforced the principle that **clean, validated data is the foundation of meaningful analysis**, especially in environmental/air quality contexts.  
By combining rigorous cleaning with insightful visualization, *Air Aware* provides a compelling narrative on ozone trends and helps elevate data-driven awareness of air quality issues.
