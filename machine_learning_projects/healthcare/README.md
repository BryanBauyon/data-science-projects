# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques.  
It was completed as part of the **Data Science and AI Professional Certificate Course (Xaltius Academy)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **predictive model** that can accurately classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease.  

By analyzing a comprehensive set of patient attributes — including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors — the model aims to identify patterns and features that are indicative of the presence or absence of heart disease.

## 🧠 Techniques and Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and encoding categorical features, handling missing values  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Recall, Precision, ROC-AUC  
- **Visualization:** Correlation heatmaps, feature importance, and performance plots
