# 💰 Loan Default Prediction Project

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan default.  
It was completed as part of the **Data Science and AI Professional Certificate Course (Xaltius Academy)**.

## 🎯 Objective
In the financial industry, it is crucial for lenders to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers before granting loans or credit.  
Identifying potential defaulters — individuals who are at a higher risk of failing to repay their debts — helps financial institutions mitigate losses and maintain a healthy lending portfolio.  

The goal of this project is to develop a **predictive model** that can accurately classify borrowers as *defaulters* or *non-defaulters* based on various financial and demographic factors.
